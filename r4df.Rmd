# Import Data as Tibbles (`tibble`) with `reader`

For this tutorial we will use data on the [OSU Men's Basketball games from the 2018 - 2019 season](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/ohio-state/2019-gamelogs.html), excluding any games in the ongoing [2019 NCAA Tournament](http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/tournament/bracket/_/id/201922/2019-ncaa-tournament) where OSU is an 11 seed. While an 11 seed isn't great, have a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a1TUszkMfI) by Jon Bois which explains some of the weirdness around certain seeds in the tournament.

(This data was not used during the live tutorial, but is much easier to understand, and better for sharing publicly.)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
osu_bb = read_csv(file = "data/osu-bb-2019-games.csv")
```

```{r}
osu_bb = read_csv("data/osu-bb-2019-games.csv", 
    col_types = cols(Date = col_date(format = "%m-%d-%y"),
                     # OPPPF = col_skip(), 
                     # OPPTOV = col_skip(),
                     `3PPERC` = col_number(), 
                     FGPERC = col_number(), 
                     FTPERC = col_number(), 
                     OPP3PPERC = col_number(), 
                     OPPFGPERC = col_number(), 
                     OPPFTPERC = col_number()))
```

# Data Wrangling with `dplyr` and Friends

## Data Formatting

- "Import Dataset" Tool
- `lubridate`
- `stringr`
- `forcats`

```{r}
osu_bb$Date[1:5]
```

```{r}
day(osu_bb$Date[1:5])
yday(osu_bb$Date[1:5])
week(osu_bb$Date[1:5])
year(osu_bb$Date[1:5])
month(osu_bb$Date[1:5])
```

```{r}
unique(osu_bb$Opponent)[1:20]
```

```{r}
str_count(unique(osu_bb$Opponent)[1:20])
```

```{r}
str_subset(unique(osu_bb$Opponent)[1:20], "State")
```

```{r}
str_locate(unique(osu_bb$Opponent)[1:20], "State")
```

```{r}
head(osu_bb$Home)
unique(osu_bb$Home)
```

```{r}
# change NAs to H for "home"
osu_bb$Home = fct_explicit_na(osu_bb$Home, "H")
```


```{r}
ggplot(osu_bb, aes(x = Home)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  coord_flip()
```

```{r}
ggplot(osu_bb, aes(x = fct_infreq(Home))) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  coord_flip()
```

```{r}
levels(as.factor(osu_bb$Home))
levels(fct_infreq(osu_bb$Home))
```

## One-Table `dplyr` Verbs

- `mutate()` - Create new variables
- `select()` - Working with columns
- `filter()` - Working with rows
- `arrange()` - Reordering rows
- `summarise()` - Reduce data to summary statistics
- `group_by()` - Use above operations on "groups" in the data

```{r}
filter(osu_bb, Home == "@")
```

```{r}
osu_bb %>% filter(Home == "@")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
osu_bb %>% filter(Home == "@") %>% View()
```

```{r}
osu_bb %>% filter(Home == "@", OPPPTS < 60)
```

```{r}
osu_bb %>% filter(Home == "@") %>% 
  summarize(avg_fg = mean(FG))
```

```{r}
osu_bb %>% filter(Home == "@") %>% 
  summarize(avg_fg = mean(FG)) %>% unlist()
```

```{r}
osu_bb %>% filter(Home == "@") %>% 
  summarize(avg_fg = mean(FG), sd_fg = sd(FG))
```

```{r}
osu_bb %>% filter(Home == "@") %>% 
  count(Outcome)
```

```{r}
osu_bb %>% filter(Outcome == "W") %>% 
  count(Home) %>% arrange(-n)
```

```{r}
osu_bb %>% filter(Home == "@") %>%
  arrange(`3P`, desc(`3PPERC`)) %>% select(Date, Home, Opponent, Outcome, `3P`, `3PPERC`)
```


```{r}
osu_bb %>% summarize(avg_ft = mean(FT))
osu_bb %>% group_by(Home) %>% summarize(avg_ft = mean(FT))
```

```{r}
osu_bb %>% group_by(Home) %>% 
  summarize(n_ft = sum(FT), 
            avg_ft = mean(FT), 
            sd_ft = sd(FT),
            max_ft = max(FT)) %>% 
  arrange(-n_ft)
```

```{r}
osu_bb %>% mutate(shots = FG + FT, shots_2_idk = 2 * shots) %>%
  select(-OPPFG:-OPPPF)
```

## Two-Table `dplyr` Verbs

### Mutating Joins

- `inner_join(x, y)` only includes observations that match in both `x` and `y`
- `left_join(x, y)` includes all observations in `x`, regardless of whether they match or not
- `right_join(x, y)` includes all observations in `y`. Itâ€™s equivalent to `left_join(y, x)`, but the columns will be ordered differently
- `full_join()` includes all observations from `x` and `y`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
superheroes = "
    name, alignment, gender,         publisher
 Magneto,       bad,   male,            Marvel
   Storm,      good, female,            Marvel
Mystique,       bad, female,            Marvel
  Batman,      good,   male,                DC
   Joker,       bad,   male,                DC
Catwoman,       bad, female,                DC
 Hellboy,      good,   male, Dark Horse Comics
"
superheroes = read_csv(superheroes, skip = 1)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
publishers = "
  publisher, yr_founded
         DC,       1934
     Marvel,       1939
      Image,       1992
"
publishers = read_csv(publishers, skip = 1)
```

```{r}
superheroes
```

```{r}
publishers
```

```{r}
inner_join(superheroes, publishers)
```

```{r}
left_join(superheroes, publishers)
```

### Filtering Joins

- `semi_join(x, y)` keeps all observations in `x` that have a match in `y`
- `anti_join(x, y)` drops all observations in `x` that have a match in `y`

# Visualisation with `ggplot2`

```{r}
osu_bb %>% ggplot(aes(x = FTPERC)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 10) + 
  facet_wrap(~Home) + 
  labs(x = "Average CPM")
```

```{r, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 10}
osu_bb %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = FTPERC, y = FGPERC, color = Outcome, size = FG)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  facet_wrap(~Home) +
  labs(x = "Free Throw Percentage", y = "Field Goal Percentage")
```

```{r}
osu_bb %>% filter(FGPERC < 30)
```
